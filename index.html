        <h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
        <p>HUFFLEPUFF is described as the house of the loyal and the fair. The mascot is a badger- the colors are yellow and black. The founder is Helga Hufflepuff, and the earth is their element. The Hufflepuff ghost is The Fat Friar. Hufflepuffs are seen as loyal, having a good sense of fair play, and are hard working and kind. They are, however, slighted by others, and are seen as people who do not fit into the other three houses, or are seen as “weak” or “untalented”. Notable members are Cedric Diggory, Nymphadora Tonks, and Newton Scamander. Hufflepuff might have been used as a way of seeing how other misfits are unjustly seen within society, and may be saying that these supposed “oddballs” have deeper depths and have their own interests, skill sets, and talents. </p>

        <h2>Slytherin</h2>
        <p>SLYTHERIN is described as the house of the ambitious and the cunning. Their device is the serpent, and their colors are green and silver. Its founder is Salazar Slytherin, and their element is water. The Slytherin ghost is the Bloody Baron. Slytherins are known to be ambitious, yearning for power, and tend to be pure bloods. They are seen as “the worst house” in the series, and produces the most dark wizards and witches. They are portrayed as the least liked of all the four houses. Notable members are Tom Riddle (Voldemort), Draco Malfoy, and Severus Snape. They are seen and used as the “dark house” in the books, a representation of evil. However, not every Slytherin turns out dark, perhaps signifying that the concepts of good and evil are not at all straightforward, seen especially in Professor Snape. This might be used to show that even people sorted into a house like Slytherin- or in other similar real life situations- may not all be “bad”. </p>

        <h2>Gryffindor</h2>
        <p>GRYFFINDOR is described as the house of the daring and the brave. Its symbol is the lion, and its colors are red and gold, which shows this very clearly. Its founder is Godric Gryffindor. Its element is that of fire, and its ghost is Nearly Headless Nick. Students who belong in Gryffindor are normally very bold and chivalrous, but can be reckless or arrogant. Notable members are Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore. In the Harry Potter books, they are seen as the main house, into which almost every main character is Sorted, possibly to expand on their rivalry against Slytherin house, which is the house of Voldemort. It could also signify the importance of bravery within times of war, and the strength of chivalrous loyalty to one another, which Gryffindors tend to possess.</p>

        <h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
        <p>RAVENCLAW is described as the house of the wise. Their sigil is the eagle, and the colors of the crest are blue and bronze. The founder is Rowena Ravenclaw, and its element is air. The Ravenclaw ghost is Rowena Ravenclaw’s daughter, The Grey Lady, otherwise known as Helena Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw students are clever, wise, and eager to learn, but they can be seen as “weird” and are sometimes extremely competitive when it comes to exams. Notable members are Luna Lovegood, Filius Flitwick, and Cho Chang. Ravenclaw’s ghost, The Grey Lady, is notable in helping Harry in finding the Ravenclaw diadem, and her story may reflect themes of power, betrayal, envy, and pride. In members like Luna Lovegood, Ravenclaw might be interpreted in the fact that there is knowledge in everything, even in that that might not even exist, or seems impossible to believe.</p>
